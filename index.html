    <h2>Who We Treat</h2>
    <p>18+ Males</p>
    <p>Clinically-managed low intensity residential services at The Reprieve are appropriate for individuals diagnosed with a substance use and/or co-occurring disorder, who are capable of self-care but don’t have a stable home environment or are not ready to return to family or independent living.</p>
</div>

<!-- How We Treat -->
<div id="how-we-treat" class="treatment bg-light">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>How We Treat</h2>
        <p>Our patient-centric approach to care is designed to meet patient needs holistically. Positive outcomes depend on the complex interrelationship of a patient’s physical, psychosocial, spiritual, and socioeconomic status. The strength of our program lies in the balance we create between individualized treatment, a supportive peer-based community, and connection to services accessible in the community.</p>
        <p>Our elective-style program curriculum incorporates a range of therapies to meet individual recovery needs and offers scheduling flexibility for those who are employed or enrolled in school. The Reprieve group program may include, but is not limited to, the following:</p>
        <ul class="list-style-alpha" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>Upon enrollment, each resident receives a comprehensive assessment that includes a meeting with a therapist, a Certified Recovery Support Specialist and, if indicated, can include additional members of our health and wellness team.</li>
            <li>Using our comprehensive assessment as a road map of needs, our treatment team works collaboratively with the resident to develop and individualized treatment plan that includes a minimum of five (5) hours of clinically-managed treatment per week directed toward preventing relapse, applying recovery skills, and reintegrating into the community. Residents may also participate in individual therapy and peer support services as necessary.</li>
            <li>Our treatment services are uniquely designed to help our residents establish a balanced and self-sustaining life with a complete toolkit for independence.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Daily Reflection</h4>
        <p>This group meets each morning and creates accountability for residents who have not yet secured employment and/or struggle with a morning routine. The intention is for residents to start the day on the right foot. Our facilitator checks in with residents to set goals and intentions for the day.</p>
        <h4>Early Recovery</h4>
        <p>Appropriate for residents new to The Reprieve, this process-oriented group facilitates discussion around current issues pertaining to substance independence as well as relapse prevention.</p>
        <h4>Sustained Recovery</h4>
        <p>Appropriate for residents that have successfully integrated into the therapeutic community and have demonstrated a commitment to perpetual progress toward self-sustainability. This process-oriented group facilitates discussion around current issues pertaining to substance independence as well as relapse prevention.</p>
        <h4>Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)</h4>
        <p>Dialectical Behavior Therapy is an evidence-based, cognitive behavioral treatment. This group uses a step-by-step format to teach four sets of skills: mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation and distress tolerance.</p>
        <h4>Men’s Process Group</h4>
        <p>Our single gender process groups provide residents with an opportunity to safely discuss, explore and process issues directly related to men’s socio-emotional needs and health-related issues.</p>
        <h4>Family Systems</h4>
        <p>This group offers psychoeducation on family dynamics as well as a space to process these dynamics as they arise in the resident’s family and within the therapeutic community. Roles within the family/therapeutic community and how residents relate to family/community members are discussed while also taking a look at how that impacts relationships outside of the household. Larger systems such where residents go to school, work, play and worship are discussed as well. Residents have the opportunity to ask for support, validation, or skills as they relate to the subject of discussion.</p>
        <h4>Intro to Codependency (CoDA)</h4>
        <p>This group addresses issues of codependency and how codependent behaviors can impact our ability to form and maintain healthy relationships. Based off of the 12-step program Codependents Anonymous, our CoDA group integrates 12-step concepts with relevant process-based discussions.</p>
        <h4>Social Skills</h4>
        <p>Social Skills Group is a process, experiential and psycho educational group. Social interaction skills and interpersonal dynamics are explored. Role playing, verbal and non-verbal forms of communication, managing social anxiety, developing healthy relationships and boundaries are routinely discussed and rehearsed.</p>
        <h4>Executive Function & Life Skills</h4>
        <p>Executive Function refers to the ability to manage or regulate a collection of basic cognitive and emotional processes. This group focuses on developing the skills needed to effectively plan, initiate, organize and execute tasks as well as the ability to cope with transitions or regulate emotional responses. Group members create specific weekly task-oriented goals and work closely with staff on the necessary steps to incorporate these new skills into daily life.</p>
        <h4>Relapse Prevention Group</h4>
        <p>Relapse Prevention Group is both a process group and a psycho-educational group. The group discusses current issues pertaining to substance independence as well as relapse prevention planning and skills. Triggers, high risk situations, people and things are outlined and coping skills are developed, honed and practiced in a supportive environment.</p>
        <h4>The Reprieve Experience</h4>
        <p>The Reprieve Experience is geared towards new clients, individuals who are in their first 2-4 weeks of treatment. This group is an excellent way for clients to get to know each other and build a sense of camaraderie. Certified Peer Recovery Specialists help residents learn the “ins and outs” of the program including the daily schedule, personal responsibility, community activities, group therapy opportunities, and more, and to generally acclimate to life at The Reprieve in a supportive social environment.</p>
        <h4>Weekend Programming</h4>
        <p>Weekend programming helps residents connect with their peers on the weekends, which can be especially challenging for some clients navigating recovery. Weekend activities often include field trips such as going to a farmer’s market, the movies, local community events, or working together at the residence to make a family-style meal or even seasonal activities like pumpkin carving.</p>
        <h4>Unit Accountability</h4>
        <p>This mandatory unit meeting offers opportunities for residents to understand and discuss issues and reinforce a recovery-oriented culture. Typically, a variety of individual, interpersonal, and house issues are presented. Residents are responsible for positive conflict resolution and house governance using personal recovery experience as a way to help others, emphasizing recovery as an interaction between the individual and their environment.</p>
        <h4>Community Accountability</h4>
        <p>This mandatory community meeting offers opportunities for residents to understand and discuss issues and reinforce a recovery-oriented culture. Typically, a variety of individual, interpersonal, and house issues are presented. Residents are responsible for positive conflict resolution and house governance using personal recovery experience as a way to help others, emphasizing recovery as an interaction between the individual and their environment.</p>
        <h4>The Family Collective</h4>
        <p>The Family Collective is a virtual, biweekly multifamily group exclusively for The Reprieve family members to connect and learn with the support and facilitation of licensed clinicians. The psycho-educational group provides a safe space to learn about best practices that help residents successfully transition from treatment to thrive at home. It offers time for group discussion overseen and supported by licensed clinicians, and covers a new theme each week.</p>
        <p>Topics may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>“The Art of Communication”</li>
            <li>“Setting and Reinforcing Boundaries”</li>
            <li>“Maintaining Independence after Co-Dependence”</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Individual Counseling</h4>
        <p>Through focused individualized therapy with licensed professionals, residents work on critical skills including relapse prevention, social skills, distress tolerance and mindfulness to prepare for navigating life outside of treatment.</p>
        
        <h4>Peer Support Services</h4>
        <p>Each resident is assigned a Certified Peer Recovery Specialists (CPRS) that is formally trained to leverage their lived experience in recovery to both facilitate support groups and work with residents one-on-one. CPRSs support program participants in achieving their individual treatment plan goals by helping them to access community services available, teaching basic life skills such as bill paying and how to keep appointments, and providing guidance and encouragement along the recovery journey to keep residents engaged and realize their full potential.</p>
        
        <h4>Outcome Measurement</h4>
        <p>The Reprieve leverages cutting-edge technology to engage clients while measuring outcomes utilizing the Recovery Capital Index (RCI), a person-centered and scientifically validated tool to reliably measure addiction wellness regardless of treatment modality, recovery pathway, or substance of use. The RCI is a holistic tool for a complex condition which provides a multidimensional measure of wellbeing. Care across multiple providers treating an individual can be personalized and success can be reinforced.</p>
